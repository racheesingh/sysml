# Cornell CS5470: Systems for Large-scale ML
This course explores the systems challenges of training and serving large-scale ML models like GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek. You will learn how to design and operate distributed training and inference on multi-accelerator hardware, with attention to performance, memory, communication, and fault tolerance. The emphasis is on both theory and practice so we will combine  with hands-on programming sessions, assignments and projects. By the end, you will have practical experience tackling the core bottlenecks of modern ML systems.

Acknowledgement: the compute in this course is supported by a [NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/) Education Allocation Award.


# Access to GPU Compute resources
If you are enrolled in the class or you are on the waitlist, create a NERSC account by following the instructions [here](https://docs.nersc.gov/accounts/). Each created account undergoes vetting so please do this as soon as you can.
